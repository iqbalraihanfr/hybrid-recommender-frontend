A modern and responsive movie recommendation frontend built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
The UI replicates Netflix-style profile selection and recommendation layout, allowing users to:
	â€¢	Select a user profile
	â€¢	View recently watched movies and their ratings
	â€¢	Receive personalized movie recommendations

Poster images are fetched from the OMDb API, while all recommendation logic and data are provided by a separate backend service.
